      <h2>Notes on the species</h2>
      <div>
        They seem to have a fairly good germ rate, and are quick to show it.  All my seeds so far have been purchased
        from Sacred Seed in Toronto or https://magicactus.com/.  I find magicactus has more varieties available, but I've
        only ever bought seeds from him.  He sells mature plants, but the price of even a 2 year old l. Williamsii is
        encouragement to keep growing from seed as much as possible.  Only charlie I bought as a 2.5 year old - at $150 CA.

        <h3>Varieties</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Caespitosa</strong>: will easily grow multiple heads without any decapitation happening.  This makes them very easy
          to propogate.  These head form large clusters known as 'planchas'</li>
          <li><strong>Menchaka</strong>: tend to have only one head, unless decapitation occurs.</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>05/2019 Batch 3: v caespitosa</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>Plants - 52 Remaining</h3>
              <div>
                These have really enjoyed the summer.  I put them all together in a wide, shallow clay pot, and
                they're thriving.  Should I just plant the seeds in a pot like this?  Maybe I'll try that with
                the next batch.

            <h3>Seedlings - 69 remaining</h3>
              <div>
                These guys benefited from lessons I learned in previous batches - they got a longer incubation,
                and it shows.  They've largely settled into the plump globular shape that I'd expect from adults.

            <h3>Sowing the seeds: 05/2019</h3>
              <div>I sowed 100 seeds in 3 X 2 inch plastic pots in a plastic bin with lid.  It looked like about 64
                germinated to begin with, but it was hard to get an exact count because of the way they werre scattered,
                and it looked like a few more were trying to put down roots.</div>

            <h3>Plants - 5-6 Remain</h3>
            <div>These have largely matured.  They grow slowly, but they have the proper shape of the species, and
              they're showing the tiny tufts of hair common to the species.  One individual looks like it's passed,
              but the rest seem healthy, if drastically different in size.

                I have had better luck keeping tiny pots in a clear tupperware container for a longer
                incubation period.  I'll do that from now on and probably do a lot better.

            <h3>Sowing the seeds</h3>
              <div>
                20 seeds - a 2 inch plastic pot in a baggy
                15 seedlings remain as of 05/2019.  They are bright green and lush.  A couple are oddly shaped.  I am currenly using an LED grow light,
                and I am considering whether or not flourescent might be a better option in general, although I worry it might be too much for seedlings.
                These ones seem happy enough and I don't really want to mess with that.  They'll be in plastic for a few more months, all going well.

                This is one of the only cacti I own that I didn't plant. He was 2.5 years old when I picked him up (Spring 2018-ish).
                Still quite small, as these fellas tend to be, but seems happy enough.  I have upgraded his pot a couple of times, and
                he's starting to show fresh bulges of growth on top, so I'm excited to see how those play out.

              <div>
                There are a lot of things I could have done better.  I hope future batches are much more successful.
                I sowed 30 seeds - half in a plastic icecube tray with a plastic cover and half in a 2 inch clay pot in a baggy. Many were
                misshapen and odd looking.  I took the seedlings out of plastic much earlier than I needed to and they seemed small and stunted
                compared to other seedlings which were planted later.  The ones in the icecube tray had a much better germination rate.
                There were some redish tinges for a little while, and I experimented with moving the seedlings further from the light,
                which led to yellowing and stretching.
