      <h2>Notes on the species</h2>
      <div>
        Used by the indegenous people of the andes for their alkaloid content and sold in markets.There are different 'kinds'
        depending on the number of ribs. Cacti with seve ribs are the least potent and most common.
        Cacti with four ribs are rare , considered the more potent and belived to have special power because each rib
        corresponds with one of the â€œfour winds" (4 cardinal directions), and its use dates back to 3000+ years ago.  All
        my trich seeds are from Magiccactus.com, currently

            <h3>Mixed Up</h3>
              <div>
                I seem to have mixed both batches together in one pot, and I can no longer tell
                them apart.  Probably the tag was faded and I mis-read... at any rate, they all still live.
                All 18.  I'm not sure why these are growing slower than the other trichocereus species,
                and it seems fewer have survived as well.  I may need to try another batch of these in
                the future.

            <h3>Seedlings</h3>
              <div>
                These are looking sturdy.  I have to now be more careful about how often I water - I've lost
                a couple 2 rot.  They can no longer get the same care I gave to them when they were seedlings,
                so it's time to start treating them like tiny but mature plants.

              <div>
                <p>
                  I planted 30 seeds in batches of 10 and 20. 19 Seelings germinated from this batch, still incubated and looking bigger and stronger than their slightly
                older siblings.  As of July 23, 18 still live, out of incubation</p>

                  All the T Pachanois seem smaller - shorter and stalkier, than the other Trichocereus

            <h3>Sowing the seeds</h3>
              <div>
                <p>I planted 20 seeds, 9 germinated</p>
                <p>
                  This first batch was in the unfortunate group of freshly sown seeds that I knocked over.  I was surprised
                  to see anything germitate.  Their little spines are adorable.  I did take them out of incubation long before
                  I would have liked - I was concerned about fungus, and the baggies I used weren't sealed well around the
                  2 inch clay pots - I forgot how quickly those guys can leach out moisture.  Clay is good for hardened cacti,
                  but I won't use it again for seedlings without a fully sealed container.

                <p>As of July 23, 8 still live.</p>
