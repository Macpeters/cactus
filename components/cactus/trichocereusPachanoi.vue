            19 Seelings survive from this batch, still incubated and looking bigger and stronger than their slightly 
            older siblings.

              This first batch was in the unfortunate group of freshly sown seeds that I knocked over.  I was surprised
              to see anything germitate.  Their little spines are adorable.  I did take them out of incubation long before
              I would have liked - I was concerned about fungus, and the baggies I used weren't sealed well around the
              2 inch clay pots - I forgot how quickly those guys can leach out moisture.  Clay is good for hardened cacti,
              but I won't use it again for seedlings without a fully sealed container.
