      <div>
        <h3>Sowing the seeds: 04/2019</h3>
          <div>I had 30 seeds split into batches of 10 and 20, with varying light conditions.  
            More light had 50% germ rate, compared to 10% for less light.</div>

        <h3>Seedlings</h3>
          <div>
            Altogether there are 13 seedlings - tall, skinny little things with adorable little spines trying 
            to form.  Still incubating.

            There is but one lone survival of this batch.  He's going to join the lopophoras that came out of incubation 
            too early - hardened off and stuck under 24 hour flor lighting to see how he likes it.
