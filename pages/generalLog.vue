      <h2>Aug/2020</h2>
      <div>
        I put all my plants outside for the summer, and while I've definitely had some losses,
        those who survived have really stepped up. The torches, in particular, have gained some inches
        and no longer look like seedlings at all.  One sedum has been thriving so well, it's got a whole
        wide clay pot all to itself, and it's starting to look like it'll be cramped soon.  It's nearing
        the end of summer, and everyone will be coming inside in a month or so, so I don't think I'll see
        a lot more action, but I'm pretty excited about what's been happening so far.

        Notable losses: I am down to one pot of t. Pachanoi - clearly I've been neglegting something these
        guys need.  The other 2 trichocereus species have been thriving enough that I've got at least 1 example
        from the first batch.  Why is this species suffering?

        Charlie has a whole new pile of bulges in the top - I have only the 1 menchaca variety of
        l. Williamsii, and he's the furthest ahead all his species, so I'm curious to see how those bulges play out.
        My crassula was no longer viable, and has been broken into a bunch of smaller props made from leaves or stems,
        so I'll have to see how those play out in the next year or so.

        I definitely neglected my last batch of seedlings.  I have another 100 l. Williamsii seeds headed my way.  I'll
        wait until I've got everyone inside and my lights back on before planting them, but I want to pay more attention
        to them, especially once they're out of  incubation.   Maybe I'll get some more t. Pachanoi as well, since so
        few have survived.  I have to wonder, why, though?  Why of the three tricherceresu species I planted
        at that time, did t. Pachanoi do so poorly?  What can I do differently to ensure their survival?

        I have tried to keep the tags from fading out, but written directly on the tag, the ink fades very quickly, and
        my accuracy at reading that stuff is not great.  I have started putting the information on stickers, and putting the stickers
        on the tags, and that lasts a lot longer.  Between my re-writes on faded tags and this log, I think I've got everything
        sorted out for the year.  Going forward, there will hopefully be less confusion.
