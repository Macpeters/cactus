        <p>
          I grabbed most of the basic facts on each cactus from Wikipedia - I'll update and
          suppliment as I come across other useful facts and/or discover things through my
          own experience.  All pictures labeled with "Sample" were grabbed straight from
          a google image search - I'll replace them when I have pictures of my own, but since
          I mostly have seedlings right now, I just wanted to be able to see what the adults
          might look like one day.

        <h2>Cactus/Succulent Seed Retailers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://sacredseed.com/" target="_blank">Sacred Seed</a>
            - I like this place because I can go in person. I haven't ordered from them online, so
            can't speak to that.</li>
          <li><a href="https://magicactus.com/seedsales.html" target="_blank">Magic Cactus</a>
            - a Toronto, Canada retailer named Frank (no paypal - prefers e-transfer)</li>
          <li><a href="http://cactusstore.com" target="_blank">Cactus Store</a>
            - lots of varieties, as well as mixed packs which let you try out a bunch of different species</li>
          <li>Seed World on Amazon - not recommended.  I didn't get what I expected and the order took forever to
            show up.  In the end, it wasn't even cheaper than a regular seed retailer, so save yourself
            the hassle.
